Forte is music visualized. It provides musicians with the ability to upload, view and play back their music through a user friendly interface. What sets Forte apart is the ability to quantify music as hard data that gets run through complex analysis to provide the user with metrics on their work. 

Forte was built over 8 days on Rails and focuses heavily on JavaScript and C3 data visualizations.
